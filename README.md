Module 1 Challenge Code

First, I added flex and wrap to the header so that the header box will resize when the window compresses and the header links fall below the main header.

Second, I added a few @media screens to edit some of the code when the window compresses and will discuss them below
  Made the .content boxes display to contents to allow it to strech from the left to the right when the benefits section drops below the content.
  Added a few lines of code to make the bennefits section strech from left to right to fill the screen
  Added a height dimension to fit the content of the paragraph text and allow the box to grow as the text grew
